                        <p><i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i>, an emerging zoonotic pathogen, is able to cause rapid cell death using a type III secretion system on it's first chromosome. Although the links to pathogenicity are not completely clear, what is clear is that this molecular weapon is a powerful tool against human cells. Focusing on how T3SS-1 is acivated, we aim to outline how T3SS-1 performs in <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> borne gastroenteritis.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h3 class="major">Genetic Activation of the T3SS</h3>
                        <p><i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> is an ocean microbe that is found worldwide, albeit more commonly in warmer ocean waters. These microbes, like most <i>Vibrios</i> have complex interactions with a variety of ocean plants and animals, although most importantly <i>V. parahaemolyticus </i> can colonize oysters. This colonization is the main entry of <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> into the human food chain, where certain strains are able to cause an gastrointestinal infection that leads to an acute, generally self-limiting diarrhea. However, this infection can progress to be more serious or life-threatening in the extremes of age (very young/very old) and the immunocomprimised.</p>
                        <p><i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> has two T3SS's (T3SS-1 and T3SS-2) which it utilizes for host cell cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity respectively. Our lab is primarily focused on T3SS-1, which is implicated in rapid host cell cytoxicity in vitro, and clinical isolates containing only the T3SS-1 have been isolated.</p>
                        <p>Our lab has been investigating the master regulator for T3SS-1, <i>exsA</i>. This regulator is a member of the AraC family of transcriptional regulators, and is itself regulated by a series of complex mechanisms at both the protein and genetic level. Two promoters generate the <i>exsA</i> transcript: the <i>exsB-exsA</i> cotranscript and the <i>exsA</i> trasncript, generated by the <i>exsB</i> and <i>exsA</i> promters respectively. However, a large intergeneic region upstream of <i>exsA</i>, which contains the <i>exsA</i> promoter, regulates much of the <i>exsA</i> transcript found in the cell. By studying this <i>exsA</i> promoter region, we hope to elucidate the mechanism's of <i>exsA</i> genetic activation, so that we can understand the activation of the T3SS-1 foundationally.</p>
                        <p>Recent research from our lab has identified HlyU, a regulator of a hemolysin in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, as a genetic activator of <i>exsA</i>. Using a transposon mutant library, in a unique reporter strain containing the lux reporter attached to the the <i>exsA</i> promtoer region, integrated into the chromosome, we not only identified HlyU as a genetic activaotr, but also verified other studies that identified H-NS as a major repressor of the <i>exsA</i> locus.</p>
                        <p>To follow up on this research, our lab is currently looking for other regulators and interrogating the binding site for HlyU in the <i>exsA</i> promoter.</p>

                        <h3 class="major">Chitin and N-acetylglucosamine 
                                        utilization and its links to pathogenesis</h3>
                            <p>Many human pathogens are able to use N-acetylglucosamine, a 5-carbon sugar, as a carbon source. Further, many are able to detect N-acetylglucosamine and these sensing mechanisms are required for adequate virulence. For example, it has been shown that N-acetylglucosamine sensing in <i>C. albicans</i> is necessary for human virulence.</p>
                        <p><i>Vibrio</i> spp. are ancestrally environmental organisms that have become human pathogens. More importantly, Chitin, an N-acetylglucoasmine polymer found as the second most abundant natural carbon polymer in the world, is a primarly food source for these bacteria in the ocean. Recent studies have shown that <i>V. cholerae's</i> ability to bind Chitin and N-acetylglucosamine, through the N-acetylglucosamine binding protein A (GbpA), is necessary for human colonization and infection.</p>
                        
                    <p>Our lab has recently begun exploring how N-acetylglucosamine, and chitin, are utilized by <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> and what connections this utilization might have to human colonization and virulence. We are investigating an innovative technique called transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) to do this. Using population genomics, tied to transposon mutagenesis, this technique allows us to identify genome-wide mutations that are important for a particular process.</p>
